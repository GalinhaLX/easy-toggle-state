<!--
The data-toggle-class attribute tells this button
to toggle the class `is-checked` on itself on click.

The data-toggle-radio-group attribute tells that this button
is a part of the `radioGroup2` group: only one of them can be active at a time.
Since it's a radio group, this group will always keep one of its triggers active.

The data-toggle-arrows attribute allows you to navigate
through the buttons of the `radioGroup1` group with the arrow keys.
